State of the Art

Learning Website about Procedural Art with interactive examples.

2021 Kyle Coulon | This is a mock art education site for a student project
School: BYU Idaho
Working towards: Applied Technology Bachelors Degree, and Web Development Certificate

This was my end-of-semester project for my first Web Design and Development class (WDD130)

Much of the CSS and Javascript is a mess, but I'm proud I was able to complete such an ambitions first personal page.
My experience with Game Development helped me to make the interactive Javascript examples.

All art resources were made by me, using Photoshop and Blender
